# Union_FixSetViewport
Union_FixSetViewport is a plugin that fixes problem from "Fix 1px cutline in zCView objects" Union patch which can result in out of bounds ViewPort.  
Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 uses Direct3D7 Renderer API which seems to not like out of bounds ViewPorts and it often causes a very huge lag or even crashes the game.
